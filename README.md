### Examples
[gcode-preview.web.app/examples/](https://gcode-preview.web.app/examples/) — small standalone pages showing how to
drive the library from your own code: loading and streaming G-code, replaying a print move by move, wiring a layer
slider, handling a dropped file, building a stats panel, and using the parser with no renderer at all. Each page shows
its own code next to what that code draws, and you can edit it and re-run it in place. No build step, no framework.
They live in [`demo/examples`](demo/examples) and are served by `npm run dev` at http://localhost:8080/examples/.

## Installation

`npm install gcode-preview`

GCode Preview depends on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and supports `three` `>=0.166.0 <0.186.0`.

### Module format (3.0)

The package is ESM-only. Import from `gcode-preview`; the only other public
package path is `gcode-preview/package.json`. Deep imports such as
`gcode-preview/dist/gcode-preview.es.js` are no longer supported, and the
legacy UMD build / `GCodePreview` browser global has been removed.

TypeScript supports `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` module resolution.
Legacy `moduleResolution: "node"` can still resolve the root import through
`types`; no `typesVersions` mapping is needed for the current root-only API.

For native browser modules, map `three` in an import map and load
`dist/gcode-preview.es.js` as a module. When self-hosting, copy the **entire
`dist` directory**, including any chunks. The debug GUI (`lil-gui`) is bundled,
so it needs no separate install or import-map entry. The GUI remains synchronous;
bundling adds roughly 9 KB gzipped even when `devMode` is disabled.

### Quick start

```js
  import { GCodePreview } from 'gcode-preview';

  const preview = new GCodePreview({
      canvas: document.querySelector('canvas'),
      extrusionColor: 'hotpink'
  });
  
  // draw a diagonal line
  const gcode = 'G0 X0 Y0 Z0.2\nG1 X42 Y42 E10';
  preview.processGCode(gcode);
```

The same setup, with a bed under it and enough moves to spell something, is a runnable page: [`demo/examples/minimal.html`](demo/examples/minimal.html).

G-code can also be streamed in and rendered progressively:

```js
  const response = await fetch('benchy.gcode');
  await preview.processGCodeStream(response.body.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream()));
```

`processGCodeStream` reads text chunks, so decode a `fetch` byte stream first — see
[`demo/examples/streaming.html`](demo/examples/streaming.html).

### Constructor options

The main options accepted by `new GCodePreview({ ... })` (see the
[API docs](https://gcode-preview.web.app/docs) for the full reference):

- `canvas` — the canvas element to render to
- `buildVolume` — renders the build volume (see below)
- colors: `backgroundColor`, `extrusionColor`, `travelColor`, `topLayerColor`, `lastSegmentColor`, `boundingBoxColor`
- render toggles: `renderExtrusion`, `renderTravel`, `renderTubes`, `disableGradient`
- geometry: `lineWidth`, `lineHeight`, `extrusionWidth` — per-path dimensions from `;WIDTH:` / `;HEIGHT:` slicer comments always win (adaptive layer height renders correctly); `lineHeight` / `extrusionWidth` fill in for paths without them, and built-in defaults (0.6 width / 0.2 height) apply last
- layer range: `startLayer`, `endLayer`
- camera: `orthographic`, `initialCameraPosition`
- streaming: `liveRenderInterval` (throttles progressive rendering)
- arcs: `arcChordTolerance` (tessellation precision for G2/G3)
- misc: `droppable` (drag & drop g-code files onto the canvas), `devMode` (debug GUI + stats), `keepLines`, `minLayerThreshold`

After construction, most rendering properties live on the scene manager and can
be changed at runtime, e.g. `preview.sceneManager.renderTubes = true`, followed
by a re-render.

## Feature description

### Supported G-code commands

The interpreter currently handles:

| Command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `G0` / `G1` | linear move |
| `G2` / `G3` | clockwise / counter-clockwise arc |
| `G20` / `G21` | set units to inches / millimeters |
| `G28` | home |
| `G31` | straight probe |
| `G38.2`–`G38.5` | probe family |
| `G92` | set position |
| `G92.1` | reset coordinate system offsets |
| `T0`–`T7` | tool selection |

Commands without a handler are parsed but ignored by the interpreter.

`G92.2` and `G92.3` are not supported.
Standalone `;WIDTH:<mm>` and `;HEIGHT:<mm>` comments (emitted by PrusaSlicer,
SuperSlicer, OrcaSlicer and Bambu Studio) are picked up by the slicer metadata
pipeline and set the extrusion width and line height of the paths that follow,
so prints sliced with adaptive layer height render with the true dimensions of
each path. Dimensions resolve per path: the slicer-announced value wins, the
`lineHeight` / `extrusionWidth` options fill in for paths without one, and the
built-in defaults (0.6 width / 0.2 height) apply last.

### Multi-color support

GCode files that were sliced for a multi-tool system can be previewed as such. Pass an array of colors as the `extrusionColor` constructor option (or assign `preview.sceneManager.extrusionColor` at runtime), where the index in the array corresponds to the index of the tool: T0..T7. 

example: 
```js
extrusionColor: ['hotpink', 'indigo', 'lime']
```
Here, T0 is hotpink, T1 is indigo and T2 is lime.

Supported systems include:
 - Prusa MMU1/2/3 and XL
 - Bambulab AMS & AMS lite
 - Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder (ERCF)
 - IDEX machines
 - toolchangers
 - 3D Chameleon
 - Virtual tools (color mixing)
 - and possibly more

### Render extrusion as tubes
Extrusions are rendered as tubes by default; pass `renderTubes: false` as a
constructor option to render flat lines (it can also be toggled at runtime
via `preview.sceneManager.renderTubes`):
```js
new GCodePreview({ canvas, renderTubes: false });
```

### G2/G3 arc support
Thanks to @Sindarius arc commands are now supported, which means gcode processed by ArcWelder should be rendered correctly.

### Thumbnail preview
Thumbnail previews as generated by PrusaSlicer are detected and parsed. In the gcode these are found in comments, enclosed between 'thumbnail begin' and 'thumbnail end'. The images are encoded as base64 strings but split over multiple lines. These are now parsed and patched back together, but still kept a base64. This allows easy use in the browser for us as [data urls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6931167b-d48e-44a8-9233-ec8dbc064a0b) *Thumbnail Preview as generated by PrusaSlicer*

The thumbnails can be accessed like this: 
`gcodePreview.parser.metadata.thumbnails['220x124']`

Thumbnails have a `.src` property that will create a usable data url from the base64 string.

See an [example in the demo source](https://github.com/xyz-tools/gcode-preview/blob/develop/demo/js/app.js#L43-L50).

### Build volume
The build volume will be rendered if the `buildVolume` parameter is passed. It has the following type: 
```ts
buildVolume: { 
  x: number; 
  y: number; 
  z: number;
  smallGrid?: boolean;
}
```
Negative dimensions are clamped to 0.

example:

## Development
To develop on gcode-preview run:

`npm i && npm run dev`

This runs the demo app which is fairly complete in using the libs features.

If you don't need the demo app, just run `npm run dev:watch`.

Both build a dev bundle in the `dist` directory.
Note the dev bundle:
 - is not minified
 - has no type defs (.d.ts)

### Submitting a PR
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guidelines. In short, before submitting a PR run:
- `npm run check` (test + typeCheck + lint)
- `npm run build` for a production build
- `npm run test:coverage` — CI requires 100% coverage for every file under `src/`

To auto-fix simple issues:
- `npm run lint:fix` or `npm run prettier:fix`

### Production builds
For working on production builds you can use:
- `npm run demo` which does a prod build and launches the demo app using local server
- or just `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch`

## Known issues
### Preview doesn't render in Brave
This is caused by the device recognition shield in Brave. By changing the setting for "Device Recognition" in Shield settings to "Allow all device recognition attemps" or "Only block cross-site device recognition attemps" you should not get this error.
