## Installation

 `npm install gcode-preview`

### Quick start

```  
  import * as GCodePreview from 'gcode-preview';

  const preview = GCodePreview.init({
      canvas: document.querySelector('canvas'),
      extrusionColor: 'hotpink'
  });
  
  // draw a diagonal line
  const gcode = 'G0 X0 Y0 Z0.2\nG1 X42 Y42 E10';
  preview.processGCode(gcode);
```

 There's a [Vue.js example](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/tree/develop/vue-demo) that has a [Vue component](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/blob/develop/vue-demo/src/components/GCodePreview.vue) to wrap the library.

 @Zeng95 provided a [React & Typescript example](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/tree/develop/react-typescript-demo) that has a [React component](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/blob/develop/react-typescript-demo/src/components/GCodePreview.tsx) to wrap the library.

 There is a [Svelte example](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/tree/develop/svelte-demo) with a [Svelte component](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/blob/develop/svelte-demo/src/lib/GCodePreview.svelte).

## Feature description

### Multi-color support

GCode files that were sliced for a multi-tool system can be previewed as such. Assign an array of colors to the `extrusionColor` property, where the index in the array corresponds to the index of the tool: T0..T7. 

example: 
```
extrusionColor: ['hotpink', 'indigo', 'lime']
```
Here, T0 is hotpink, T1 is indigo and T2 is lime.

Supported systems include:
 - Prusa MMU1/2/3 and XL
 - Bambulab AMS & AMS lite
 - Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder (ERCF)
 - IDEX machines
 - toolchangers
 - 3D Chameleon
 - Virtual tools (color mixing)
 - and possibly more

### Render extrusion as tubes
```
renderTubes : true
```

### G2/G3 arc support
Thanks to @Sindarius arc commands are now supported, which means gcode processed by ArcWelder should be rendered correctly.

### Thumbnail preview
Thumbnail previews as generated by PrusaSlicer are detected and parsed. In the gcode these are found in comments, enclosed between 'thumbnail begin' and 'thumbnail end'. The images are encoded as base64 strings but split over multiple lines. These are now parsed and patched back together, but still kept a base64. This allows easy use in the browser for us as [data urls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).

The thumbnails can be accessed like this: 
`gcodePreview.parser.metadata.thumbnails['220x124']`

Thumbnails have a `.src` property that will create a usable data url from the base64 string.

See an [example in the demo source](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/blob/v2.5.0/demo/demo.js#L190-L204).

### Build volume
The build volume will be rendered if the `buildVolume` parameter is passed. It has the following type: 
```
buildVolume: { 
  x: number; 
  y: number; 
  z: number
}
```

example:

<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/461650/103179898-c014a100-4890-11eb-8a25-13415c26f0f4.png' width=200>

## Development
To develop on gcode-preview run:

`npm i && npm run dev`

This runs the demo app which is fairly complete in using the libs features.

If you don't need the demo app, just run `npm run dev:watch`.

Both build a dev bundle in the `dist` directory.
Note the dev bundle:
 - is not minified
 - has no type defs (.d.ts)

### Submitting a PR
Before submitting a PR run:
- `npm run build` for a production build
- `npm run test` for unit tests
- `npm run typeCheck` for typescript typings
- `npm run lint` for code style and formatting
- or all together: `npm run build && npm run test && npm run typeCheck && npm run lint`

To auto-fix simple issues:
- `npm run lint:fix` or `npm run prettier:fix`

### Production builds
For working on production builds you can use:
- `npm run demo` which does a prod build and launches the demo app using local server
- or just `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch`

## Feedback
If you have found a bug or if have an idea for a feature, don't hesitate to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/remcoder/gcode-preview/issues/new) or [talk to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/w2bsGRE6S4).

## Contributing
It would be great if you want to help! Maybe you'd like to help out with:

 - testing GCode Preview with a variety of gcode files, from different slicers
 - making GCode Preview suitable for different printer types, like Deltas, Belt printers, IDEX, etc.
 - please report any bugs you find and add as much detail as possible, or even better, a screenshot
 - even better yet: send in a pull request :-)
 - apart from the main code, lots of improvements can still be made in:
   - documentation
   - unit tests
   - examples

## Contributors

## Known issues
### Preview doesn't render in Brave
This is caused by the device recognition shield in Brave. By changing the setting for "Device Recognition" in Shield settings to "Allow all device recognition attemps" or "Only block cross-site device recognition attemps" you should not get this error.
